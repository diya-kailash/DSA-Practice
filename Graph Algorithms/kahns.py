# Kahn's Algorithm for Topological Sort using BFS
# Time Complexity: O(V + E)
# Space Complexity: O(V)
# When to Use: Use Kahnâ€™s Algorithm for topological sorting of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) when you need a queue-based, non-recursive approach to handle task scheduling, dependency resolution, and build ordering.
