# Time Complexity:
# - Building target count map: O(m), where m = len(t)
# - Sliding window over s: O(n), where n = len(s)
# - Each character is added and removed from window at most once
# - Total: O(n) since m â‰¤ n

# Space Complexity:
# - counts and window hashmaps store up to k unique characters 
# - Other variables use O(1) space
# - Total: O(k), where k = number of unique characters in s and t
