# Time Complexity:
# - encode:
#     - Iterating through all strings: O(m), where m = number of strings
#     - Appending string with length prefix: O(len(s)) for each â†’ total O(n)
#     - Final join: O(n)
# - decode:
#     - Scanning through the encoded string: O(n) where n = sum of lengths of all the strings
# Space Complexity:
# - encode:
#     - List `parts` stores encoded strings: O(m)
#     - Final encoded string: O(n)
# - decode:
#     - Result list stores all original strings: O(m)
